    <iWant>define and prioritize the core feature set for the SpeedLink MVP</iWant>
    <soThat>development efforts are focused on delivering essential functionality within the 1-week timeline</soThat>
    <tasks>
      - Task 1: Review comprehensive requirements and categorize features (AC: 1, 4)
      - Task 2: Assess technical complexity and dependencies (AC: 2, 3, 5)
      - Task 3: Define MVP scope and document feature specifications (AC: 1, 6)
      - Task 4: Validate feasibility and finalize scope (AC: 7)
    </tasks>
  </story>

  <acceptanceCriteria>
    1. MVP feature list is documented with clear scope boundaries
    2. Each MVP feature includes implementation complexity estimate (S/M/L/XL)
    3. Feature dependencies and critical path are identified
    4. Non-MVP features are clearly separated for future releases
    5. MVP feature list aligns with technical architecture constraints
    6. Feature list includes acceptance criteria for each MVP component
    7. Resource allocation and timeline feasibility is validated
  </acceptanceCriteria>

  <constraints>
    - Ultra-low-latency requirement: ≤800ms for party updates
    - PWA must support offline functionality and installability
    - System must handle 1000+ concurrent parties at scale
    - All communication must be encrypted (HTTPS/WSS)
    - GDPR-compliant data handling required
    - Battery optimization for background location updates
    - 1-week MVP timeline constraint for ruthless prioritization
    - No app store dependencies - web-based deployment only
  </constraints>
  
  <interfaces>
    <!-- To be defined during implementation - no existing APIs -->

  <tests>
    <standards>No existing testing framework - will be established during scaffolding phase. Testing standards should include unit tests, integration tests for real-time functionality, performance tests for latency requirements, and PWA compliance tests.</standards>
